# Paper Space game source

This repository is the source code of a small game I published on [itch.io](https://flashjaysan.itch.io/paper-space) and made with the game engine [Defold](https://defold.com/).

You can use the source to make any project but do NOT use visual and audio assets since they were created by my son so I don't own the rights.
